## Description

This is Dream Control, a Unity 3D platformer born from a three-hour game creation challenge with my brother, where each of us crafted a game. Embark on a dark journey through the depths of the subconscious mind. Navigate through dream levels and cutscenes as you attempt to save... yourself.
